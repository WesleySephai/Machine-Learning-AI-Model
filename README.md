## Machine Learning
 • Subset of Artificial intelligence
 • Designing of systems that can learn and do predictions based on some experience
 • Enabling computers to modify or adapt their actions such that the actions become more accurate
 
 • Examples:
 • Email spam filtering
 • Image recognition
 • Recommendation System and many more

 ### Artificial Intelligence (AI): 
 The broad field of creating machines that simulate human intelligence, enabling them to perform tasks like reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
 
 ### Machine Learning (ML): 
 A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.
 ### Deep Learning (DL):
 A specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns, often used for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

# Linear-Regression-Model
Build a model to predict salary based on the number years of experience.   Data: Use the Salary_Data dataset and analyse the relationship between YearsExperience and Salary variables using a linear regression.
