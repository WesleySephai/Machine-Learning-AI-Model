## Machine Learning
 • Subset of Artificial intelligence
 • Designing of systems that can learn and do predictions based on some experience
 • Enabling computers to modify or adapt their actions such that the actions become more accurate
 
 • Examples:
 • Email spam filtering
 • Image recognition
 • Recommendation System and many more

 ### Artificial Intelligence (AI): 
 The broad field of creating machines that simulate human intelligence, enabling them to perform tasks like reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
 
 ### Machine Learning (ML): 
 A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.
 ### Deep Learning (DL):
 A specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns, often used for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

## Key Terminologies and concepts

• Training Data: Known data

• Training Dataset: Set of the complete training data

• Testing Data: Unknown/Unseen data

• Testing dataset: Set of the complete test data

• Model: Algorithm that is being trained

• Training of a model: Generalizing the model based on training dataset to predict results of test data

• Testing of a model: Predicting the results for test data 

• Evaluating a model: How good the model performs for unseen data



# Supervised Learning
 • Known target label
 • Ex: Spam classification, Image classification, Gender classification

 ### Classification
 • To identify the category of the data i.e. target label (categorical data)
 • Algorithm learns from the training data and identifies the category or class of the test data

 Algorithms: 1. Logistic Regression, 2. KNN, 3. Super Vector Machine, 4. Decision Trees, 5. Random Forest

### Regression
 • To identify the value of the dependent variable
 • Target variable is real valued
 • Ex: House price prediction, temperature prediction

 Algorithms: 1. Linear Regression, 2. K Nearest Neighbours, 3. Super Vecto Machine, 4. Decision Trees, 5. Random Forest
 
# Unsupervised Learning
 • Target label is not defined
 • Try to identify similarities between the data provided 
• Categorize them based on the similarities

### Clustering
 • An unsupervised machine learning technique 
• Group similar data points into clusters based on their features. 
• Unlike classification, clustering works without labeled data, 
• Aims to discover the underlying structure in the data.

# Applications
 • Healthcare: Disease prediction, drug discovery.
 
 • Finance: Fraud detection, stock price prediction.
 
 • Retail: Customer segmentation, inventory optimisation.
 
 • Transportation: Autonomous vehicles, route optimisation.
 
 • Entertainment: Content recommendation, video game AI.

 # Challenges
 
 • Data Quality: Incomplete or noisy data.
 
 • Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on test data.
 
 • Bias and Fairness: Ethical concerns in model decisions.
 
 • Interpretability: Understanding model decisions


# Flow of a Machine Learning Project

1. Understand the Problem Statement
2. Data Gathering/ Data Collection
3. Decide data science terchnology to be used -> DL, ML, NLP
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Decide the base line in ML model
6. Training the model on training data
7. Evaluate the model on the testing data
8. Hyper parameter tuning
9. Re-evaluate the model
10. Base line model 2

# Project
### Linear-Regression-Model
Build a model to predict salary based on the number years of experience.   Data: Use the Salary_Data dataset and analyse the relationship between YearsExperience and Salary variables using a linear regression.
