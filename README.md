## Machine Learning
 • Subset of Artificial intelligence
 • Designing of systems that can learn and do predictions based on some experience
 • Enabling computers to modify or adapt their actions such that the actions become more accurate
 
 • Examples:
 • Email spam filtering
 • Image recognition
 • Recommendation System and many more

 ### Artificial Intelligence (AI): 
 The broad field of creating machines that simulate human intelligence, enabling them to perform tasks like reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
 
 ### Machine Learning (ML): 
 A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.
 ### Deep Learning (DL):
 A specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns, often used for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

## Key Terminologies and concepts

• Training Data: Known data

• Training Dataset: Set of the complete training data

• Testing Data: Unknown/Unseen data

• Testing dataset: Set of the complete test data

• Model: Algorithm that is being trained

• Training of a model: Generalizing the model based on training dataset to predict results of test data

• Testing of a model: Predicting the results for test data 

• Evaluating a model: How good the model performs for unseen data



# Supervised Learning
 • Known target label
 • Ex: Spam classification, Image classification, Gender classification

 ### Classification
 • To identify the category of the data i.e. target label (categorical data)
 • Algorithm learns from the training data and identifies the category or class of the test data

### Regression
 • To identify the value of the dependent variable
 • Target variable is real valued
 • Ex: House price prediction, temperature prediction
 
# Unsupervised Learning
 • Target label is not defined
 • Try to identify similarities between the data provided 
• Categorize them based on the similarities

### Clustering
 • An unsupervised machine learning technique 
• Group similar data points into clusters based on their features. 
• Unlike classification, clustering works without labeled data, 
• Aims to discover the underlying structure in the data.

# Applications
 • Healthcare: Disease prediction, drug discovery.
 
 • Finance: Fraud detection, stock price prediction.
 
 • Retail: Customer segmentation, inventory optimisation.
 
 • Transportation: Autonomous vehicles, route optimisation.
 
 • Entertainment: Content recommendation, video game AI.

 # Challenges
 
 • Data Quality: Incomplete or noisy data.
 
 • Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on test data.
 
 • Bias and Fairness: Ethical concerns in model decisions.
 
 • Interpretability: Understanding model decisions


# Project
### Linear-Regression-Model
Build a model to predict salary based on the number years of experience.   Data: Use the Salary_Data dataset and analyse the relationship between YearsExperience and Salary variables using a linear regression.
